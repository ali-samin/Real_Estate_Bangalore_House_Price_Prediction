# Real Estate Bangalore House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore, India, using historical data. The prediction model is based on various factors such as location, total square footage, number of bedrooms, and the presence of amenities.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical information about houses in Bangalore, including:
- **Location**
- **Square footage**
- **Number of bedrooms**
- **Number of bathrooms**
- **Availability of amenities**
- **Price** (target variable)

## Project Goals
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers in the dataset.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features for better model performance.
3. **Model Building**: Train machine learning models to predict house prices.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: For data manipulation and model building.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Flask**: For deploying the predictive model as a web app.

## Key Features
